# Attribution


Attribution is required for many of our data providers. Example language is provided below, but you are responsible for researching each project to follow their license terms. More details are available on the [Data Sources](./data_sources.md) page.

**Required attribution:**

>  © OpenStreetMap contributors, Who's On First

**Full attribution for all projects:**

>  © OpenStreetMap contributors

### Where to attribute

Attribution needs to "appear in a place that is reasonable to the medium or means you are utilising." [Specific examples](http://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/License#Where_to_put_it.3F) are given by the OSM Foundation and are generally best practices for giving credit to any source.

## The fine print

### OpenStreetMap

`source:openstreetmap`

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a community-driven, editable map of the world.  All OpenStreetMap data is licensed under the [ODbL](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/), a [share-alike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share-alike) license which also requires attribution.
